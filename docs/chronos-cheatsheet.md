# Chronos Cheatsheet (Legacy)

This file has moved to [`geochronos-cheatsheet.md`](./geochronos-cheatsheet.md).

If you're maintaining historical notes that still use the `chronos` code fence, the plugin continues to support it as an alias. For new notes, use the updated Geochronos cheatsheet linked above.
